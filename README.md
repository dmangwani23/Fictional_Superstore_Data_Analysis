### Key Findings and Insights
1.	West Region outperforms the East, South, and Central Regions.
   
The West Region was the best-performing region with $725K in sales and a 14.5% profit margin. Within the West region, almost 65% of total sales came solely from California – as it represents the most urbanized state within the region, thus contributing the largest percentage of sales.

2.	Technology Category outshines the rest
   
The Technology Category brought in the most sales and profits compared to the other two categories with $836K in sales, and $145K in profits (17.4% profit margin). Even though Furniture was the second best-performing category with $742K in sales, it only accomplished a 2.5% profit margin, compared to the 17% profit margin of Office Supplies.

3.	Consumer Segment drives the majority of sales
   
The Consumer Segment contributed 51% of total sales, bringing in $1.16M. Even though the consumer segment brought in the most sales and the most profits ($135K), it had the lowest profit margin with 11.55%, with the highest profit margin coming from the Home Office Segment at 14.03%.

4.	Sales and returns peak in Q4

Q4 saw the highest sales and profits with $878K and $111K respectively, compared to the other lower-performing quarters. On the other hand, Q4 also saw a spike in product returns – contributing ~40% to the total returns during 2014 to 2017. The category that saw the most returns was Office Supplies, which could indicate an opportunity for more educational and informational marketing around the products to lessen the overall returns for the Superstore.

5. Profitability suffered due to high discount rates
   
Specific items such as tables and machines were discounted heavily – with an average discount rate of 26% and 31% respectively, resulting in a loss for tables, and 1.8% profit margin for machines. Opportunities exist to improve these numbers by implementing marketing tactics such as bundling – tables could be paired up with a high-performing sub-category such as chairs, whilst the low-performing sub-categories can be tackled operationally to reduce inventory costs, boosting profitability by forecasting per-category customer demand.
